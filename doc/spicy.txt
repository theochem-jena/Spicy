@version 0.0.0.1


-- | This module deals with the partitioning of the system, creation of
--   bonds, assignment of substructeres to layers and creation of ghost
--   atoms. Following conventions shall apply:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>highest level region has highest index</li>
--   <li>lowest level region has index 0 and contains the complete
--   system</li>
--   </ul>
module Spicy.Molecule


-- | Spicy.Types contains the definition of all classes and data types,
--   that are used in Spicy. Mainly it takes care of the description of
--   molecules (structure, topology, potential energy surface, ...) and
--   computations on molecules in different software packages.
module Spicy.Types

-- | Have a class for the printing of the calculation niveau, which allows
--   to produce a very readable output.
class NiceShow a
niceShow :: NiceShow a => a -> String
niceComplex :: NiceShow a => a -> String

-- | Use serial or parallel processing for large data structures. This
--   helps deciding on a per use base, if to evaluate in serial or
--   parallel, to avoid nested parallelism. Every method employing parallel
--   operations by Control.Parallel.Strategies should provide this switch
--   in Spicy.
data Strat
Serial :: Strat

-- | Indexing type for recursive molecule structures. Count all layers with
--   a global index range (<a>Global</a>) or by fragment specific index
--   range (<a>Individual</a>).

-- | Alias for an unboxed matrix from the Array library. This type can
--   easily be converted to Accelerate's array type.
type UMatrix a = Array (Int, Int) a

-- | All chemical elements. Have them very clear because force fields and
--   pdb names may interfer and are just arbitrary strings.

-- | An atom label. They may come from pdb or force field parameter files

type AtomLabel = String

-- | These are labels for molecular mechanics software. The strings are

type FFType = String

-- | An Atom in a <a>Molecule</a>.
data Atom
Atom :: Int -> Element -> AtomLabel -> Bool -> FFType -> Maybe Double -> Vector Double -> Atom

-- | A molecule, which might be the whole system, an ONIOM layer or a
--   fragment of the system, each containing possibly even higher layers
--   for ONIOM or fragments. Stores all associated informations of a layer.
--   
--   Starting from a top level molecule, all atoms and bonds of the system
--   are expected to be in the in this top layer (except pseudoatoms of
--   deeper layers). Therefore if atoms are in a deeper layers of the
--   recursion, their information is not used to describe a higher layer.
--   Instead, all atoms of deeper layers (except pseudoatoms) must be also
--   replicated in a higher layer.
--   
--   Two possible types of index countings are possible:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><b><i><a>Global</a></i></b>: All atoms in the system (which should
--   be present at the top layer molecule) except pseudoatoms are counted
--   in the top layer. The fragments might therefore not start at atom with
--   index 0, but depending on where they are in a higher level with higher
--   numbers. Pseudoatoms are counted after all other atoms are
--   counted.</li>
--   <li><b><i><a>Individual</a></i></b>: Counting happens for each
--   molecule individually. In this counting scheme, pseudoatoms do not
--   need any special treatment.</li>
--   </ul>

-- | This module provides functions to manipulate basic data structures of
--   <a>Molecule</a>s, such as indexing.
module Spicy.Molecule.Util

-- | Calculate new indices for <a>Molecule</a>s in the <a>Individual</a>
--   scheme, where each fragment is counted by itself without awareness for
--   other molecules. This relies on sane bonds in the <a>Molecule</a>. If
--   somewhere bonds are defined to non existing atoms, these bonds will be
--   lost.
--   
--   Reindex a single layer of a molecule (topmost) but ignore its deeper
--   layers. Reindexing is done based on a replacement map, which must not
--   have any holes. So Every index that appears in the molecule must also
--   appear in the replacement list, even if this maps to the same value.
--   Otherwise a <a>Left</a> error <a>String</a> will result.
--   
--   Substitute all indices in the bonding style <a>IntMap</a> by
--   replacements given in a <a>IntMap</a> <a>Int</a>. If keys of the old
--   bonding map do not appear in the replacement map, a <a>Left</a> error
--   <a>String</a> will be given. Therefore the replacement map must be
--   complete and no holes are allowed.
reIndexBonds :: IntMap Int -> IntMap IntSet -> Either String (IntMap IntSet)

-- | Given a list of <a>Key</a>s, delete all <a>Key</a>s in the list from
--   the original <a>IntMap</a>.
deleteIntMapByKeys :: [Key] -> IntMap a -> IntMap a

-- | Given a list of <a>Key</a>s, delete all <a>Key</a>s in the list from
--   the original <a>IntSet</a>.
deleteIntSetByKeys :: [Key] -> IntSet -> IntSet

-- | Given a replacement <a>IntMap</a> (<a>Key</a> is the old value, value
--   is the new <a>Key</a>), replace the <a>Key</a>s from the old
--   <a>IntMap</a> with the ones from the replacement <a>IntMap</a>. If a
--   key cannot be found in the replacement <a>IntMap</a>, the original Key
--   of the old <a>IntMap</a> will be kept.
updateKeys :: IntMap Int -> IntMap a -> IntMap a

-- | Given a replacement <a>IntMap</a>, replace all values in an original
--   <a>IntSet</a> by values from a replacement <a>IntMap</a>. Values from
--   the <a>IntSet</a>, that have no <a>Key</a> in the <a>IntMap</a> will

updateIntSet :: IntMap Int -> IntSet -> IntSet


-- | A module which converts the internal Molecule representation to a
--   string, which is a common chemical file format, that can be read by
--   Avogadro, VMD, OpenBabel etc.. The writers are not fool proof with
--   respect to force field types, which should always be remembered when
--   usings its results.
module Spicy.MolWriter

-- | Write a Molden XYZ file from a molecule. This format ignores all deep
--   level layers of a molecule.
writeXYZ :: Molecule -> Text

-- | Write a Tinker XYZ from a <a>Molecule</a>. The writer trusts the
--   <a>_atom_FFType</a> to be correct (if set) and will simply write them
--   out. Therefore it is possible, that wrong atom types can be written.
--   If they are not set, the writer will simply equalise all atom types to
--   0, which is OK for visualisation but obviously not for MM.
--   
--   This format ingores all deeper level layers of a molecule.
writeTXYZ :: Molecule -> Text

-- | Write a simplified .mol2 file (Tripos SYBYL) from a <a>Molecule</a>,
--   containing the atoms, connectivities (single bonds only) and partial
--   charges. The writer is not fool proof and will happily accept any
--   <a>_atom_FFType</a> that is supplied, even if it is not a TRIPOS SYBYL
--   atom type. This can lead to mol2 files that have correct topology and
--   geometry, but visualisation programs wont be able to assign correct
--   elements.
writeMOL2 :: Molecule -> Text

-- | Write Spicy format, which is a custom format (not stable yet),
--   containing all informations, that are internally used to represent a
--   molecule.
writeSpicy :: Molecule -> String

-- | A molecule, which might be the whole system, an ONIOM layer or a

-- | Parse a .xyz file (has no connectivity, atom types or partioal
--   charges).

-- | Parse the "interesting" fields of a MOL2 file. This contains partial

getCoordinates2 :: Strat -> Molecule -> Vector Double


-- | This module defines basic algebraic operations used throughout the

--   The operations here accept some insecurities (like not checking if
