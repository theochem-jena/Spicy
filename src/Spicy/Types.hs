Spicy.Types contains the definition of all classes and data types, that are used in Spicy. Mainly it
takes care of the description of molecules (structure, topology, potential energy surface, ...) and
computations on molecules in different software packages.

{- $moleculeTypes
Types to describe a molecule from a computational geometry point of view. The representation of a
molecule aims to be as descriptive as unambigous as possible and capture all quantities relevant for
molecular dynamics and geometry optimisations (energies, gradients, hessians, force fiekd types,
coordinates, connectivities). Electronic properties, such as dipoles, orbitals, the wavefunction and
so on, will be ignored, as Spicy is not aiming to be an analysis program, but a interface to create
multilayer calculations. Analysis of the results is up to postprocessing.
-}

{-|
All chemical elements. Have them very clear because force fields and pdb names may interfer and are
just arbitrary strings.
